# UCL's Changing Ethnic Diversity
Visualising how University College London's ethnic diversity has changed from 2007/08 to 2021/22 with stacked bar charts in the shape of Jeremy Bentham, UCL's spiritual founder.

This was created as part of a set of promotional materials for the UCL Data Visualisation Society. 

The data was retrieved on 01 Oct 2022 from <a href = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/student-statistics" target = "_blank"><u>UCL's webpage on student statistics</u></a>. Tables T1 (UK-domiciled student numbers by ethnic group) and T2 (Non-UK domiciled student numbers by ethnic group) were used. The image used for the chart was obtained <a href = "https://twitter.com/ucl/status/1232019125138051072/photo/1" target = "_blank"><u>here</u></a> and traced out in Adobe Photoshop to create a black and white cut-out. The black represents the background of the plot while the white pixels represent the figure to be coloured in.

The .Rmd file also contains a function which can be used to create similar types of visualisations (stacked bar charts cropped in the shape of an image).
